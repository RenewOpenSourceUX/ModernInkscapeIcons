# Modern Inkscape Icons
Creating a modern colourful icon set for Inkscape

Inkscape is great. It's a really feature rich vector editing software, completely open source and relativly beautiful. In the latest Version the Inkscape contributors introduced a new standard icon theme and new standard colour theme: dark mode.

While they look beautiful together, they aren't nice to work, because of there very similar look due to their monoline style.

>Inkscape has many authors, every author retains their own copyright and authors are likewise involved in setting Inkscape's technical and project goals. There are also many other non-coding contributors who are considered important parts of the Inkscape project.

We want to eliminate this problem with our design skills and want to create an all new custom icon theme for Inkscape.

## Our Goal

Our goal should be colourful **fast and easy recognizable** icons.
They must be dark and light mode optimized and just look fine.


## How to

Inkscape allows custom icon packs in the folder:
``C:\Users\%CURRENTUSER%\AppData\Roaming\inkscape\icons``
